Dog-Cat-Panda Image Classification with ML and Django
This project implements an image classification system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of dogs, cats, and pandas. The system is powered by machine learning and features a Django-based web interface that allows users to upload images and receive classification results in real time.

Features
Image Classification: Classifies images into three categories: dog, cat, and panda using a CNN model.
Django Web Interface: A simple, user-friendly web application to upload images and receive predictions.
Real-Time Prediction: After uploading, the user receives a prediction in real-time.
Preprocessing: Automated resizing and normalization of input images.
Tech Stack
Python: Core programming language.
TensorFlow & Keras: Used for building and training the CNN model.
Django: Backend web framework for the web interface.
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap: For frontend web development.
NumPy, OpenCV: For image preprocessing and manipulation.
How to Run
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Django
TensorFlow, Keras
OpenCV, NumPy
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dog-cat-panda-classification.git
cd dog-cat-panda-classification
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Apply migrations:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py migrate
Start the development server:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py runserver
Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to access the web app.

Model Training
The CNN model was trained on a dataset of labeled images of dogs, cats, and pandas. The architecture consists of several convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers for classification.

To train the model, follow these steps:

Prepare your dataset of images.

Use the provided train.py script to train the model:

bash
Copy code
python train.py
Once training is complete, the model weights will be saved and can be loaded for classification.

Usage
Navigate to the web application.
Upload an image (either a dog, cat, or panda).
Wait for the model to classify the image and display the result.
