Dog-Cat-Panda Image Classification with ML and Django
This project implements an image classification system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of dogs, cats, and pandas. The system is powered by machine learning and features a Django-based web interface that allows users to upload images and receive classification results in real time.
Features
•	Image Classification: Classifies images into three categories: dog, cat, and panda using a CNN model.
•	Django Web Interface: A simple, user-friendly web application to upload images and receive predictions.
•	Real-Time Prediction: After uploading, the user receives a prediction in real-time.
•	Preprocessing: Automated resizing and normalization of input images.
Tech Stack
•	Python: Core programming language.
•	TensorFlow & Keras: Used for building and training the CNN model.
•	Django: Backend web framework for the web interface.
•	HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap: For frontend web development.
•	NumPy, OpenCV: For image preprocessing and manipulation.
How to Run
Prerequisites
•	Python 3.x
•	Django
•	TensorFlow, Keras
•	OpenCV, NumPy
Installation
1.	Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dog-cat-panda-classification.git
cd dog-cat-panda-classification
2.	Install the required packages:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3.	Apply migrations:
bash
Copy code
python manage.py migrate
4.	Start the development server:
bash
Copy code
python manage.py runserver
5.	Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to access the web app.
Model Training
The CNN model was trained on a dataset of labeled images of dogs, cats, and pandas. The architecture consists of several convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers for classification.
To train the model, follow these steps:
1.	Prepare your dataset of images.
2.	Use the provided train.py script to train the model:
bash
Copy code
python train.py
3.	Once training is complete, the model weights will be saved and can be loaded for classification.
Usage
1.	Navigate to the web application.
2.	Upload an image (either a dog, cat, or panda).
3.	Wait for the model to classify the image and display the result.
